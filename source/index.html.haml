				%h3 Weatherify.
				%p My first WDI project, Weatherify takes your local weather conditions and creates a Spotify playlist based on that information.
				%p For example, if your summary is 'Partly Cloudy', Weatherify will create a playlist of tracks containing 'cloudy' in their title.

				%h3 Bero.
				%p Have you ever hidden something and guided someone to it by only stating 'hotter' or 'colder' as they moved around? Of course you have!
				%p Bero takes this concept and places it in your hand. Bero will guide you to a destination of your choice or if you're lucky enough, a friend who has connected with you. The closer you get, the hotter (redder!) your screen becomes, just follow the arrow.

					Bubble allows you to find something similar in the digital sea.
